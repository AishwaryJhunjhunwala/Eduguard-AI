# 🛡️ EduGuard AI  
### An AI-Powered Student Risk Prediction & Support Platform

EduGuard AI is a **full-stack web application integrated with Machine Learning** that proactively identifies academically and mentally at-risk students and enables **early intervention** through predictive analytics, counseling insights, and intelligent alerts.

The platform empowers educational institutions to **reduce dropout rates**, **improve academic performance**, and **support student well-being** using data-driven decision-making.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Educational institutions often respond **too late** to student struggles due to:

- Limited visibility into student engagement patterns  
- Absence of early-warning and predictive systems  
- Manual and reactive monitoring of academic and behavioral data  

As a result, students at risk of dropping out or facing mental health challenges go unnoticed until it is too late.

**EduGuard AI solves this problem** by predicting risks early and enabling timely, targeted support.
